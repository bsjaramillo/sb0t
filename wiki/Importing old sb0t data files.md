# +Importing old sb0t data files+


The data files in sb0t 5 have been significantly changed from previous versions to lend to a more efficient and less processor intensive data management.  This means that previous versions of sb0t's data files are no longer compatible with sb0t 5.

However I have included means of importing some of the old sb0t data files.  Specifically the various filter files, and the strings template file.

Old MOTD files are still compatible with sb0t 5, and do not require any adjustment.

+**Importing strings template**+

If you wish to continue to use a sb0t 4.xx strings template with sb0t 5, you can complete the following procedure.

* On sb0t 5, click "open data folder".
* Open the folder entitled "TEMPLATE IMPORTER".
* Copy your old sb0t 4.xx template into this folder.
* Restart sb0t 5.
* On sb0t 5, click "start server"
* Open the LOG.txt file to discover if the import was a success.

+**Importing filter data files**+

If you wish to continue to use sb0t 4.xx filter files (wordfilters.xml, joinfilters.xml, filefilters.xml, pmfilters.xml), you can complete the following procedure.

* On sb0t 5, click "open data folder".
* Open the folder entitled "FILTER IMPORTER".
* Copy your old sb0t 4.xx filter data files into this folder.
* Restart sb0t 5.
* On sb0t 5, click "start server"
* Open the LOG.txt file to discover if the import was a success.
